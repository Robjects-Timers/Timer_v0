# TIMER_V0
There's nothing more satisfying than tweaking a coding project to your very-human fastidious wants & needs. For this homework assignment, I'm giving you guys (& girls, etc., etc)  the opportunity to make this a better project before it turns better than anyone in the ____________________. 

<!--[TODO: add finished product image]-->
This is the first of many iterations of the engineering design process with the intention of making a timer product from scratch.

##### Context: 
This idea resulted from the frustration and problem that occurred from not being able to focus on my tasks due to being distracted from my ~~phone~~__________________.Perhaps some of you might just be able to leave your phone with effortless determination. I currently (2025-2026) rather procastinate with and replace a bad habit with a less worse habit, biased by own brain of course. If you find my projects interesting and useful, please consider donating or supporting my [YouTube Channel]() to fund the completely free, open-source projects intended for the community!
