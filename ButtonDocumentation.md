#### 2. What is a trigger switch Overview:
-------------------

With any kind of timer, we need a way to signal to the timer and tell it:
"hey, start your time."


However, as good engineers, we want to futher break down the LOGIC and sequential events that lead up to the eventual final event.

[ANIMATION/DIAGRAM/FLOWCHART OF the 1-5 steps of setting off a generic timer]

Breaking down each step sequentially really isolates what is occuring and clarifies any lost or hidden steps that we might have neglected or never realized of a seemingly simple procedure. For instance, some phones even have to ability to use switches that work as hardware triggers in addition to software triggers themselves to not only turn off a timer, but to also repeat it again. 

And, although this timer might be considered 'low-tech', it has very versatile logic and incredible design that enables configuration of almost all types of buttons that can transfer a large range of voltages. In fact, the circuit is so well designed that, you don't even technically need a switch to get it working. All you need is some wires and a lot of impatience! :P

This is great since this reduces the chance for mistakes and errors that could destroy our pace in our sprint to the finish as the hardware is more forgiving. If you could get just a tiny bit of voltage through a switch actuation, you could get a working relay from pushing, sliding, rocking, rotating, throwing, pulling, key-turning, heating, magnetizing, kicking, snapping, licking,...any physical interaction 


Here are just a few possibilites out of the million  different types of sizes, poles, form factors, pin configurations:
- Push Button
- Limit Switches
- Rocker
- Slide
- Toggle
- Tactile switches
- reed switches
- magnetic switches


Yeah... There are a lot of ways to describe switches. In fact, if we were to really dive into semantics, buttons generally describe **momentary switches**, as activating the button means pressing down, which just feels like momentary control. In addition, if you think about it,there are buttons everywhere, from pianos that can't hold a note forever to computer keyboards that just give you the allusion of  perpetual activation. Although incredibly ubiquitous, momentary switches are one of the 2 categories that describe switches.

or this timer and other options similar to this one, there are many different configurations possible.
