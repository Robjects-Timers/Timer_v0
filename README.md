# TIMER_V0

-------------------

# Overview

[TODO: add finished product image]


``` 
[ DELETE BLOCK AFTER IMPORT ]
This repository will be the first of multiple iterations, with each iteration aimed at improving specific criteria and ultimately creating the best solution using all research and data gathered the final iteration. The iterative approach will allow us to incorporate feedback, address limitations, and create real solutions quickly that may be replicated and exported to suit whatever use case your imagination and persistence grows.
 
 
This iterative design methodology aligns with best practices in solution development, enabling us to progressively enhance the timer's performance and usability based on real-world testing and user feedback.
By continuously refining the solution through successive iterations, we can ensure that the final version of the timer is optimized to effectively mitigate the impact of distractions and support sustained focus on important tasks. 

This timer will help you manage your time more effectively, allowing you to focus on your work and achieve your long-term goals. Additionally, by repetitively partaking in actions that benefit you in the future, the brain is subsequently rewired in a process known as [self-directed neuroplasticity](https://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=ma_hhs). For instance, by engaging in repetitive, intentional action, the brain triggers a series of neurological changes. Over time, this leads to the formation of new neural pathways that build cognitive reserve and incredibly make intellectually stimiluating activities seem natural!

## Context

This idea resulted from the frustration and problem that occurred from not being able to focus on my tasks due to being distracted from my phone. And while perhaps some of you may just be able to, very admirably, leave your phone with relentless determination, and move on to your long-term goals as effortless as it was to do the other habit.
That being said, we have to be both wise and smart and reduce the amount of mental friction we intend to have to partake; otherwise, I don’t stand a chance changing my behavior and might end up worse than I started from the depression of failure. Due to this, I will work on replacing the worst habit of checking my phone and ‘less worse’ habit such as working on these engineering projects so that either way, I am procrastinating, but I am still inside the mental (and physical) environment that my day-to-day career tasks which might end up indirectly improving my productivity.

## Specific Problem to Solve

Essentially, I want to eliminate the justification of using my phone for time related apps such as timer, stopwatch, clock, alarm, etc.?

Objectively, this problem is arguably nonexistent if you use only the productive apps for its intended purpose while trying to focus on your long-term goals without distractions.

But really… You do that 100% of time? Really bro...? (props if you honestly do though!)

## Solutions

I will be creating several iterations of full hardware/software prototypes that use different hardware/software every iteration. The hope is to incrementally increase complexity of builds that stick to specified criteria common for creating tech solutions.

```

  "why don't you just buy a cheap clock, you goon? Arrr ya dumb or something...?" - online troll somewhere

  My response: Yes... you can solve this problem simply with a quick purchase of a timer, stopwatch from a 1 minute search on Amazon. However, that won't really solve the problem at hand and create a alternative procrastination habit useful for my career goals. Also, where's the fun in buying a solution that won't impact you at your very core increasing the probability of success in defeating your bad habit...? 
  And, where else can you flex your engineering skills from all different fields of engineering, and have a chance to showcase to my fellow engineering community that can laugh or implement their own projects incrementally improving your life in the best way? 

```

 I'll be constantly working on different projects apart from these iterations. If you find my projects interesting and useful, check out my [YouTube Channel]() where I post videos of completed builds (projected 2025) of which showcase the free, open-source projects intended for the community!

### Objectives

-------------------

- **Goal:** Design a timer from scratch in minimal time
- **Constraint**: Speed
- **Pros & Cons of Build**
| Pros                                                                                                | Cons                                            |
