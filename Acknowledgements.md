## Notes & Considerations:
- Understand while this version is completely free and adaptable for whomever may want it, keep in mind I do not recommend this be the first process for professionals (also why it is "version 0") 
- Do not recommend for those with educational experience or intention in the field of creating products or those or professionals that want a well-rounded researched time without such extreme time-constraints.
- Even though I accomplished the feat of my goal; In hindsight, I missed out on better researched, analyzed decisions that could come arise from either having an additional member to check my on the spot, critical-thinking ideas. Which, ultimately, resulted in me having made some rather unwise, unintelligent design decisions in the financial, hardware selection of which I had to stubbornly stick through for the purpose of finishing quick and fast. 

- This is why I have labeled this project as "Timer-V0" and made it public as although flawed, it authentically shows that imperfections and mistakes can be made, even from me with more experience. Additionally, it still might be very beneficial and encouraging for those with little to no design experience, or those frustrated from option paralysis of all the stacks of data. Sometimes, in the grand scheme of the entire design process, more advantage and learnings could be gleaned from just making a decision and finding it was a mistake. Mistakes are inevitable, and the quicker you get to them, the faster you learn and make improvements rather than be stuck reviewing and overthinking things needing action. There is something incredibly that seems to occur in your brain from feeling shame and anxiety gained, although incredibly unwarranted, from failure. It is always what you do afterword in the end that determines your result and improvements over the long run.

- This could have very easily been avoided had I spent more time in research or even having someone else check my train of thought where I can review more than a few options to make better on the spot decisions.

Because Rendition Version 0 is so incredibly f While I 

Keep in mind that in order to optimize speed in the attempt of creating the project in a day, there were some very flagrant considerations that I had to temporarily ignore and mentally restrain (with agonizing difficulty) myself from the good engineering habits in order to meet the requirements.
- The need for portability
- Optimization of energy
- 

- Although for some people the solution can apply with no problem, there are still some very real applications and/or tools needed for your work-related activities such as utilization of alarms, using calculator apps, two-factor authentication, and in case of emergency calls, you just aren't quite able to remove the need for a phone in the viciinity that requires your attention. that might truly be more productive or necessaryt to get work-related tasks


_Mistakes I wish I understood before developing:_

I can remember, almost painfully, stubbornly sticking to a solution despite clear steps which have resulted in sleepless, irritated sleepless nights,

 Admittedly, I have not always followed this approach, especially in my earlier years of prototyping and with projects done entirely independently. I would hastily convince myself that if I tried to take a break, my solution created at a later time wouldn't  be nearly as good or worse, I would never finish my project. Only through the stubbornness and the brutal mistakes that only arise from frequent overnight failure, I learned it is better to follow take breaks and listen to the voice. The voice that wisely tells me to realign yourself, consolidate you and tell you that it is okay to make mistakes. Taking a step back to ensure you acknowledge them might seem uneccessary and take to long, but it allows you and your body to learn from them and predict the pattern again in the future builds. I know all too well the process of forgetting and stubbornly repeating diving into rabbit holes as I loved to justify the additional information that would have been lost had I taken a break.
 
 I learned that despite this, I tended to forget those things much more easily due to the other negative effects that come with the neurotic tendencies of the 'stop till I drop approach' such as losing sleep, not eating, and/or not exercising just to finish. 
 Ultimately, it is your design and you can take whatever actions in the path to accomplishing your projects, but I know reducing extremely long pursuits of the same project resulted in the most impact, as it allows me to be more consistent, which in the long run will always provide you better results.
 
  Finding the voice that mixes the motivation with logical reasoning has been one of the most impactful changes I made, 

  at an easy solution that would have been much quicker and potentially time saving fix that was revealed to me once I stepped back and realigned myself with the new constraints or details of a problem.
 
 'what is relevant to provide the best solution' 
 
  and consider options in the continuous design and building phase
 
  and when to dive into a solution. time and time again, especially when I am in a rush to finish things, I find myself to make more mistakes that could have been avoided. Had I just taken even two minutes to think out the entire process.
 
  before making any quick decisions, let's go ahead and think about a potential alternative before unnecessarily wasting chunks of time and frustration.
