# Timer_v0
This is the first of many iterations of the engineering design process with the intention of making a timer product from scratch.

###Goal: Creating a timer product from scratch

###Constraint: Speed
##info: Here the focal point that drives every decision in the engineering design process (Definition of goal, hardware research,selection, configuration, enclosure, and finalization)

##Note: Understand while this version is completely free and adaptable for whomever may want it, keep in mind I do not recommend this be the first process for professional (also why it is "version 0") or those with educational experience in the field of creating products or those or professionals that want a well-rounded researched time without such extreme time-constraints.
Even though I accomplished the feat of my goal, I missed out on better researched, analyzed decisions that could come arise from either having an additional member to check my on the spot, critical-thinking ideas.

In hindsight, This resulted in me having made some rather unwise, unintelligent design decisions in the financial, hardware selection of which I had to stubbornly stick through for the purpose of finishing quick and fast. 

However, for those with little to no design experience, or those frustrated from option paralysis of all the stacks of data, I recommend this type of design. This is due to the fact that more advantage and learnings could be gleaned from just making a decision and finding it was a mistake. Mistakes are inevitable, and the quicker you get to them, the faster you learn and there is something incredibly that seems to occur in your brain from feeling shame and anxiety gained, although incredibly unwarranted, from failure. It is always what you do afterword in the end that determines your result and improvements over the long run.

This could have very easily been avoided had I spent more time in research or even having someone else check my train of thought where I can review more than a few options to make better on the spot decisions.

##Considerations:
Keep in mind that in order to optimize speed in the attempt of creating the project in a day, there were some very flagrant considerations that I had to temporarily ignore and mentally restrain (with agonizing difficulty) myself from the good engineering habits in order to meet the requirements.
- The need for portability
- Optimization of energy
