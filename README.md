# Timer_v0
This is the first of many iterations of the engineering design process with the intention of making a timer product from scratch.

###Goal: Creating a timer product from scratch
##Keep in mind that in order to optimize speed in the attempt of creating the project in a day, there were some very flagrant considerations that I had to temporarily ignore and mentally restrain (with agonizing difficulty) myself from the good engineering habits in order to meet the requirements.

###Constraint: Speed
##info: Here the focal point that drives every decision in the engineering design process (hardware research, selection, configuration, enclosure, and
